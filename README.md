# About This Repo
I started having fun solving problems on leetcode.com on Feb 14th and created the repo on the same day to record my solutions.
As a beginner of programming, I mainly focus on solving the problems and getting accepted by OJ. In that case, some of my algorithms may not be the simplest way to solve the problems. I'll try to optimize the algorithms when I acquire new knowledge about programming languages and data structure/algorithms.
Thank you for paying attention to my repo. If you have any suggestions please let me know.
