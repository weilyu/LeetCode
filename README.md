# About This Repo
I started having fun solving problems on leetcode.com on Feb 14th and created the repo on the same day to record my solutions.
As a beginner of programming, I mainly focus on solving the problems and getting accepted by OJ. Some of my algorithms may not be the simpleset way to solve the problems. I'll try to opitimize the algorithms when I aquire new knowledges about programming languages and data structure/algorithms.
Thank you for paying attention to my repo. If you have any suggestions please let me know.
